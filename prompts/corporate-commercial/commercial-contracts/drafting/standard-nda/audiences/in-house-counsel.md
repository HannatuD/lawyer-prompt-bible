**Audience = In-House Legal Counsel**

- Keep a professional tone; legal jargon acceptable.
- Highlight any **non-standard terms** (e.g. carve-outs, indefinite term) in a separate “Issues” section.
- Provide a one-paragraph risk note on enforceability of injunctive relief.
- End with suggested red-flag questions for the counterparty.
